## Visual Results


Here we provide additional results. The rightmost image is the ground truth, the red masks are for the query image, and blue masks are from the support images (i.e. 5 blue masked images means we are training with 5-shot setting). The red masked image on the left of the rightmost image is our predicted mask.
